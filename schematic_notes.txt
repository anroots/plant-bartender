IC1 - Attiny85 IC, 8mhz. Chosen over the Atmega385 for simplicity and cost factors, alsp the 85 seems to be more versatile in terms of power input.

J2 is for ISP cable

The moisture sensor provides an analog signal analog IN pin 2
The tank water level sensor is two wires, in the water tank. Water provides resistance change. The signal is pulled LOW via R1. D4 protects from reverse current from Pin 3 (which switches between input/output mode)

The piezo and LED2 act as the only output interface, providing a sound when the water tank is empty.

R2 is a potentiometer which controls the amount of water pumped on every pump cycle.
Q2 gives power to all three sensors. The sensors are normally OFF to conserve power and only switched on when measurements are needed.
Q1 controls the motor. D2 protects the tank water sensor and Pin 3 from reverse current when S1 is used to power the motor manually. The motor is activated by pin 3, which switches from input to output for that time only.
S1 is manual control for the motor.
D3 protects from a reverse power surge when the motor turns off.
